## Adding Custom Particle Shapes

You can easily extend the library with your own particle shapes by creating a new class that extends `ParticleShapeRenderer`:

```dart
class HeartShapeRenderer extends ParticleShapeRenderer {
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas, Paint paint, double size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.moveTo(0, size * 0.3);
    
    // Left curve
    path.cubicTo(
      -size * 0.6, -size * 0.3, 
      -size * 1.2, size * 0.6, 
      0, size
    );
    
    // Right curve
    path.cubicTo(
      size * 1.2, size * 0.6, 
      size * 0.6, -size * 0.3, 
      0, size * 0.3
    );
    
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }
}
```

## Animation Types

Choose from multiple animation patterns:

- `AnimationConfetti.fountain`: Particles shoot upward and fall back down
- `AnimationConfetti.explosion`: Particles expand outward from center
- `AnimationConfetti.fireworks`: Burst pattern with varied speeds
- `AnimationConfetti.rain`: Particles fall from top of screen
- `AnimationConfetti.falling`: Similar to rain but with more random horizontal movement
- `AnimationConfetti.tornado`: Swirling pattern around a central point

## Color Themes
